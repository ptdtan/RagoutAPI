Description
-----------
Ragout (Reference-Assisted Genome Ordering UTility)
is a tool for reference-assisted assembly. Given a set of initial sequences 
(contigs/scaffolds) and one or multiple references (complete or draft) as input
it produces a chromosome-scaled assembly (as a set of gapped scaffolds).

The approach is based on the analysis of medium- and large-scale rearrangements
(like inversions or chromosomal translocations) between the input genomes
using breakpoint graph.

The first version of Ragout was limited to bacterial genomes only,
but currently there is an experimental support of mammalian-scaled genomes as well.
